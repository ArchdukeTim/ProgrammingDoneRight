==================
Variables
==================

In programming, a variable is something can be given a value.
A variable's name can be the letter a, the word frog, or just nonsense, like
dj6vEc1418. You can give a variable a value using the ``=`` sign::

    x = 3
    frog = 2
    dj6vEc1418 = "Apple"


Notice that the value assigned to a variable can change. It can be a number,
a word, or even another variable.

Variables are probably the most used programming feature. They help keep track
of data, and are the essence of object-oriented programming, which is what FRC
is.

In FRC, variables are usually things like motors, sensors, and joysticks.

Naming
------

Giving variables good names is an integral part of writing good code. You will most likely be working with other people on you code, and it is important that they can read and understand your code just as well as you can. By naming your variables clear, concise names, it makes reading code in the future 10x easier. For example::

  ts = 100
  topSpeed = 100

It is clear that the name ``topSpeed`` is a better variable name, because you can understand what the variable is. ``ts`` on the other hand isn't very understandable, and you'll have to look at other code to figure out what it means.
