Loops
=====

Whenever you need a block of code to execute multiple times, or until a condition is met, you should use a loop.

While Loops
-----------
While loops are the simplest loops. They loop **while** a condition is met. This could be if you're reading a file, and you want to keep reading until the end of the file, or if you have a video game, and want to keep running forever.

For Loops
---------
For loops are useful for looping a certain number of time. They work just like while loops, but have syntactic sugar to create them.

Break
-----
If you want to leave a loop in the middle of it, you should use the ``break`` keyword. This breaks you out of the current loop.

Continue
--------
If you want to immediately go to the next iteration of the loop, use the ``continue`` keyword.
